    <h2>5 Common Phone Problems and How to Fix Them</h2>
    <p><strong>Posted on:</strong> August 8, 2025</p>

    <h3>1. Phone Not Charging</h3>
    <p>This is often caused by a faulty charging port, dirt inside the port, or a bad cable. First, clean the port gently using a soft brush...</p>

    <h3>2. Slow Phone</h3>
    <p>Clear background apps, uninstall heavy apps, and free up storage space. For Androids, try a cache clean via settings.</p>

    <h3>3. Cracked Screen</h3>
    <p>Always use a screen guard and casing. For cracked screens, bring the phone in for repair — it's best not to DIY this one.</p>

    <h3>4. Overheating</h3>
    <p>Keep your phone out of the sun and close background apps. If the battery is swollen, it needs replacing.</p>

    <h3>5. Apps Crashing</h3>
    <p>Clear app cache or reinstall the app. Make sure your system software is up to date.</p>
